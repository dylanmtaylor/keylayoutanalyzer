Keyboard Layout Analyzer
=================

This project allows you to compare the usage of each key in a user entered block of text for the QWERTY, Colemak, and DVORAK keyboard layouts to see which is the most efficient. This program counts the number of occurences of each key press and highlights the keys a shade of red depending on how often they are pressed. Typically a keyboard layout with more usage around the home row is more efficient.
